In this folder you can find some examples which are "web optimized",
meaning these VNag scripts can be used in the browser
(either visible or invisible).

Web optimized scripts can be viewed by a human (if the output is visible)
or by a remote machine using the VNag webreader plugin.

The detection if the plugin is accessed through a browser
or the CLI is a core functionality of VNag.
